## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

You need to configure these variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Database Configuration (REQUIRED)
DATABASE_URL="mysql://username:password@your-host:3306/scriptflow"

# Deepgram API Configuration (REQUIRED)
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY="your_deepgram_api_key_here"

# Next.js Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NODE_ENV="development"
```

### 2. Get Your Deepgram API Key

1. Go to [deepgram.com](https://deepgram.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Get $200 credit (~750 hours of transcription)
4. Copy your API key to the `.env` file

### 3. Set Up Database (PlanetScale)

1. Go to [planetscale.com](https://planetscale.com/)
2. Create a new database called `scriptflow`
3. Get your connection string
4. Update `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file
5. Run database migration:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

### 4. Install Dependencies & Start Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🔄 Current Status

### ⚠️ Outstanding Issues

1. **ESLint TypeScript Errors** (IN PROGRESS)
   - Need to fix remaining `any` types in API routes
   - Build currently fails due to linting errors
   - Most Prisma-generated files are now properly ignored

2. **Database Setup** (PENDING)
   - User needs to configure PlanetScale database
   - Run `npx prisma migrate dev` after database setup

3. **API Key Setup** (PENDING)
   - User needs to add Deepgram API key to `.env` file

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Fix remaining TypeScript errors**
2. **Set up your database connection**
3. **Add your Deepgram API key**
4. **Test the transcription functionality**

## 📋 Remaining Phases

- **Phase 4**: Queue, Cron & Cost Guard-Rails
- **Phase 5**: Observability & Error Handling
- **Phase 6**: Deployment & Documentation

## 🔍 Testing the App

Once you've completed the setup:

1. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the transcription flow**:
   - Go to `/transcribe`
   - Enter a YouTube URL
   - Watch the real-time transcription process
   - View the interactive transcript at `/video/[videoId]`

3. **Test the dashboard**:
   - Go to `/dashboard`
   - See your transcription history
   - Server-side pagination working

## 🚨 Known Issues

1. **Linting errors preventing build** - Some `any` types need to be fixed
2. **Database connection required** - Won't work without proper DATABASE_URL
3. **API key required** - Transcription won't work without DEEPGRAM_API_KEY
